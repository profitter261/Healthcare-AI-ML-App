# Healthcare-AI-ML-App
I have made an end-to-end AI web app for patient diagnostics and healthcare using publicly available and standard datasets  
Some of the man use cases is that this app can do:-

- Risk Stratification (Classification): Early detection of diseases like diabetes, heart disease, cancer staging.
- Length of Stay Prediction (Regression): Forecast patient hospitalization duration for resource planning.
- Patient Segmentation (Clustering): Group patients into cohorts (e.g., chronic vs. acute, lifestyle-driven vs. genetic-risk).

This app has features like:-
- Imaging Diagnostics (CNN): Automate radiology analysis for X-rays, CT, or MRI (e.g., pneumonia detection).
- Sequence Modeling (RNN/LSTM): Track patient vitals over time to forecast deterioration or readmission.
- Clinical Report Summarization: Use BioBERT/ClinicalBERT for clinical notes, discharge summaries, drug side effects.
- Healthcare Chatbot: Patient triage bot for symptoms, appointment scheduling, and FAQs.
- Translator: Bridge doctor–patient communication in regional languages.
- Feedback System(sentiment analysis): Capture patient experience from feedback/reviews to improve hospital services.

Data Set:
● MIMIC-III or MIMIC-IV (clinical records, vitals, diagnoses).
● PhysioNet (time-series vital signs).
● Chest X-ray 14 / NIH Dataset (image dataset for CNN).
● Patient feedback dataset (e.g., hospital review portals, Kaggle).
● Synthetic dataset (if real-world data not available, anonymized).
Format: CSV/Parquet for tabular (EHR), JPG/PNG for images, TXT for notes. Variables: age, gender, vitals, lab results, diagnoses, medications, procedures, outcomes.

Results:
Accurate disease classification (>80% F1).
Regression: MAE < baseline for hospital stay predictions.
Meaningful patient clusters (distinct profiles).
Association rules interpretable by clinicians.
CNN detects pathologies at ≥ human-level baseline accuracy.
RNN/LSTM captures patient deterioration patterns.
Pretrained BioBERT improves clinical NLP tasks.
Chatbot gives relevant answers with <5% error.
Translator achieves BLEU score > baseline; usable for patient-doctor communication.
Sentiment model detects dissatisfaction trends for hospital QA teams.
